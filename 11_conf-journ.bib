abstract = {This paper examines sensor fusion techniques for modeling opportunities for proactive
speech-based in-car interfaces. We leverage the Is Now a Good Time (INAGT) dataset,
which consists of automotive, physiological, and visual data collected from drivers
who self-annotated responses to the question "Is now a good time?," indicating the
opportunity to receive non-driving information during a 50-minute drive. We augment
this original driver-annotated data with third-party annotations of perceived safety,
in order to explore potential driver overconfidence. We show that fusing automotive,
physiological, and visual data allows us to predict driver labels of availability,
achieving an 0.874 F1-score by extracting statistically relevant features and training
with our proposed deep neural network, PazNet. Using the same data and network, we
achieve an 0.891 F1-score for predicting third-party labeled safe moments. We train
these models to avoid false positives---determinations that it is a good time to interrupt
when it is not---since false positives may cause driver distraction or service deactivation
by the driver. Our analyses show that conservative models still leave many moments
for interaction and show that most inopportune moments are short. This work lays a
foundation for using sensor fusion models to predict when proactive speech systems
should engage with drivers.},

Using the same technique, our system has 85\% accuracy and 72\% recall for discriminating one subject in a population of 16. Identifying the exact person in a set of 3 subjects has an accuracy higher than 91\%. We also show that we can infer the correct class for a previously unseen subject in a group of 3 subjects by using one-class SVM, with 75\% average overall accuracy and 83\% average recall.}

In this ongoing research, we study outdoor pedestrian activity in New York City, specifically using (a) video streams gathered from public traffic cameras (b) dashcam footage from vehicles driving through the city, and (c) mobile phone geo-location data volunteered by local citizens. This project seeks to form a multi-scale map of urban mobility and space occupancy under social distancing policy. The data collected will enable researchers to infer the activities, contexts, origins, and destinations of the people in public spaces. This information can reveal where and, in turn, why stay-at-home orders are and are not being followed. As a work in progress, it is yet too early for detailed findings on this project. However, we report here on several unanticipated factors that have already influenced the course of the project, among them: the death of George Floyd and subsequent protests, data collection challenges, changes in the weather, and the unexpected nature of the progression of COVID-19.},

This paper proposes a new mechanism, Mobile PATRICIA-trie (MP-trie), for fast queries on moving objects that provides a 1000x improvement in performance over state-of-the-art spatial indexing mechanisms. We reduce the problem of spatial indexing to that of prefix-matching over binary strings, which is then coupled with off-the-shelf commercially available content-addressable memory (commonly used in IP routers for forwarding table lookups). We validate our approach on data collected from a real-world deployment in Stockholm, Sweden across 2000 cars for a period of one month.},

abstract = {With the explosion of IoT device use, networks are becoming more vulnerable to attack. Network administrators need better tools to verify and discover these devices in order to minimize attack risk. Existing tools provide rule-based assessment capabilities that cannot keep pace with the proliferation of devices. Current techniques demonstrate that given a rich set of labeled packet traces, one could design a pipeline that identifies all the devices in that trace with over 99\% accuracy [30, 32]. However, it has also been observed [25], that such techniques are brittle when no labels are available. More perniciously, they provide false confidence scores about the label they do ascribe to a sample. This paper introduces a probabilistic framework for providing meaningful feedback in device identification, particularly when the device has not been previously observed. In our work, we use stacked autoencoders for automatically learning features from device traffic, learn the classes of traffic observed, and probabilistically model each device as a distribution of traffic classes. Our experiments show that we are able to identify previously seen devices after only 18.9 TCP-flow samples with 100\% accuracy for devices where at least 50 samples are observed. We also show that we can distinguish between two broad classes of devices - IoT and Non-IoT - by examining the average number of flow classes observed over a set of samples. Our experiments show that we can infer the correct class of unseen devices with an over 82\% average F1 score and 70\% accuracy.},

abstract = {Building analytics can produce substantial energy savings in commercial buildings by automatically detecting wasteful or incorrect operations. However, a new building's sensing and control points need to be mapped to the inputs of an analytics engine before analysis is feasible and the process of mapping is a highly manual process - a key obstacle to scaling up building analytics. In this paper, we present new techniques to perform automatic mapping without any manual intervention. Our approach builds on and improves upon techniques from transfer learning: it learns a set of statistic classifiers of the metadata from a labeled building and adaptively integrates those classifiers to another unlabeled building, even if the two buildings have very different metadata conventions. We evaluate this approach using 7 days' data from over 2,500 sensors located in 3 commercial buildings. Results indicate that this approach can automatically label at least 36\% of the points with more than 85\% accuracy, while the best baseline achieves only 63\% label accuracy on average. These techniques represent a first step towards technology that would enable any new building analytics engine to scale quickly to the 10's of millions of commercial buildings across the globe, without the need for manual mapping on a per-building basis.},

These sensors have scant metadata, and are represented by ``tags'' which are obscure, building-specific and not machine parseable. We develop a human-in-the-loop synthesis technique which uses syntactic and data-driven steps to parse these sensor tags into a common namespace, which can enable portable building applications. We show that our technique allows an expert to fully parse a large fraction (\~70\%) of the tags with 24, 15 and 43 examples for three large commercial buildings comprising 1586, 2522 and 1865 sensors respectively, and deploy three portable applications on two buildings with less than 30 examples.},

abstract = {We study the utility of dynamic frequency agility in real-world wireless sensor networks. Many view such agility as essential to obtaining adequate reliability in industrial environments. We quantify the actual utility by identifying the two facets of connectivity graphs that yield potential benefits called Multichannel Links (MCLs) and Multichannel Triangles (MCTs), study how frequently these occur empirically and determine whether multihop provides a comparable solution without the complexity of switching channels. We examine connectivity graphs of live networks over each 802.15.4 channel and find that MCLs and MCTs are extremely rare in practice. Almost no MCLs are found in any connectivity graph while MCTs occur between 0-200 parts per million (ppm). Furthermore, we show that MCLs are rarely important for routing while each MCT has a singlechannel routing solution. We also find that there are channels that are always good for connectivity and offer comparable routing costs, with respect to transmission count, in comparison to multichannel communication. Thus, the justification for channel agility in industrial environments applies in the absence but not in the presence of multihop routing.},

The role of a location service is to map node names to topologically meaningful addresses that can be used for routing. We evaluate an implementation of BLS that works on top of BVR. BLS resolves the destination node's name to BVR coordinates and then uses BVR to route the source message to the destination node.Together, BVR with BLS offer a complete solution for scalable point-to-point routing in sensornets. We describe our design and its implementation and evaluate BLS in simulation and on a sensornet testbed. Our results show it can sustain a high look-up and routing success rate (greater than 90\% on most network sizes we tested) over various send rates and network sizes. We also compare our results to two existing point-to-point routing schemes for sensornets, and show that BLS+BVR performs comparably to state of the art point-to-point routing protocols. Finally, we demonstrate a simplified distributed hash table application implemented over BLS.},
