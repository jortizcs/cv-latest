abstract = {Medication compliance is challenging to monitor and identify because of their complex nature that is significantly influenced by the patient's behavior. Medication compliance monitoring systems are fundamental contributions to the connected health paradigm. In this paper, we propose a compliance sensing framework that does not require on-body sensing modalities or costly installation and maintenance. It uses a smart pill-bottle that utilizes Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and machine learning approaches for activity classification. The IMUs collect data about user behavior while taking medication. The collected signals are subject to pre-processing, from which features can be extracted for activity detection algorithms. Our initial results show promise in correctly discriminating medication-taking 90\% of the time compare to only moving the bottle.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present early results on the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for maximizing anomaly detection performance in buildings. We conjecture that DRL can improve performance by exploring the entire parameter space for all sensors, individually. Many anomaly detection algorithms are designed to use a single parameter for ease of use, however there are usually many parameter values that are pre-set, a priori. We hypothesize that a single threshold cannot work well for all sensors and propose the use of DRL to explore the entire parameter space. We use a deterministic policy gradient algorithm - Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)[4] - and use a building-specific anomaly detection algorithm, Strip, Bind, and Search (SBS) [2].We find that while the maximum performance achieved by both approaches is similar, the DRL-based approach is significantly less biased, more consistent - up to 3x smaller standard deviation across individual sensor scores.},

    Abstract = {In this paper, we examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of
wireless links and evaluate their effect on routing. We ran
several experiments using a testbed consisting of 57 MicaZ
motes, and collected data on link behavior over one entire
day. We use this data to observe the overall network connectivity over time and space. We are able to examine in
detail the choice of neighbors and routes using several link selection mechanisms, both statically and over time.

We are able to verify the hairy-edge hypothesis, which
states that the most important links for routing are the most difficult to predict. In order to do so, we develop precise definitions of important and unpredictable links. We also find it possible to remove these intermediate links from consideration and still have a very rich set of links to route over, while suffering from fewer difficult-to-predict links. Also, we explore the tradeoff between statically defining routes as opposed to a dynamic protocol. We find that while it is not possible to remove all temporal variations from the network, their impact can be significantly reduced through the use of local redundancy. Finally, we present a survey of how several existing routing protocols fit into the framework developed in the body of the paper.}

While there are approaches to sense and model urban occupant behaviors using sound, radio frequency, and vision, how such behaviors are altered due to city governance and policies in response to emergencies such as a natural disaster or a public health crisis has been less explored. In this paper, we present a computer vision-based approach to capture patterns and interference in the urban life of New York City dwellers from March 2020 to August 2020. Using ~1 million images gathered with cameras mounted on ride-sharing vehicles throughout the city, we approximated the social proximity of pedestrians to understand policy compliance on the street. Our analysis reveals a correlation between policy violation and virus transmission. We believe that such big data-driven city-scale citizen modeling can inform policy design and crisis management schemes for urban scale smart infrastructure.},

abstract = {Sensing activities at the city scale using big data can enable applications to improve the quality of citizen life. While there are approaches to sense the urban heartbeat using sound, vision, radio frequency (RF), and other sensors, capturing changes at urban scale using such sensing modalities is challenging. Due to the enormous amount of data they produce and the associated annotation and processing requirement, such data can be of limited use. In this paper, we present a vision-to-language modeling approach to capture patterns and transitions that occur in New York City from March 2020 to August 2020. We use the model on ~1 million street images captured by dashcams over 6 months. We then use the captions to train a language model based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation [4] and compare models from different periods using probabilistic distance measures. We observe distribution shifts in the model that correlate well with social distancing policies and are corroborated by different data sources, such as mobility traces. This language-based sensing introduces a new sensing modality to capture dynamics in the city with lower storage requirements and privacy concerns.},

    Abstract = {We study the utility of dynamic frequency agility in real-world wireless sensor networks.  Many view such agility as essential to obtaining adequate reliability in industrial environments. We introduce two facets of connectivity graphs -- Multichannel Links (MCLs) and Multichannel Triangles (MCTs) -- that identify instances in the network where switching channels may improve reliability. We study, empirically, how frequently MCLs and MCTs occur in live networks and determine whether multihop provides a comparable solution without the complexity of switching channels. We examine connectivity graphs of live networks over each 802.15.4 channel and find that MCLs and MCTs are extremely rare in practice. Almost no MCLs are found in any connectivity graph while MCTs occur between 0-200 parts per million (ppm). Furthermore, we show that MCLs are rarely important for routing while each MCT has a single-channel routing solution. We also find that there are channels that are always good for connectivity and offer comparable routing costs, with respect to transmission count, in comparison to multichannel communication.  Thus, the justification for channel agility in industrial environments applies in the absence but not in the presence of multihop routing.}

    Abstract = {This thesis examines the state of the art of building information systems and evaluates their architecture in the context of emerging technologies and applications for deep analysis of the built environment. We observe that modern building information systems are difficult to extend, do not provide general services for application development, do not scale, and are difficult to set up and manage. We assert that a new architecture must be designed with four system properties – extensibility, generalizability, scalability, ease of management – in order to address these shortcomings. Our system, StreamFS, embodies these system properties through a filesystem abstraction and a set of data services. Data services are made available to applications through an overloaded pipe abstraction. This allows for dataflow specification of processing streams to clean and analyze the streaming sensor data.

We deploy StreamFS in seven different buildings and compose several applications on top of it. One of the driving applications is a phone application called the Mobile Energy Lens. The Energy Lens provides occupants with mechanisms for collecting building information in a unified platform and provides a way to view aggregate energy consumption data associated with the spatial deployment configuration of plug-load devices. We present a three-layer architecture, where one of the main layers is implemented entirely with the data management and processing services offered by StreamFS.

We introduce the notion of verification of physical relationships through empiricial data. We partition the verification problem into three sub problems: 1) functional verification, 2) spatial verification, and 3) categorical verification. We show how empirical mode decompo- sition, correlation, and standard machine learning techniques can give us information about how the sensors are related to each other, statistically and physically. We demonstate an ex- tensible, generalizable, scalable, and easy-to-manage system for supporting the “appification” of the built environment.}

We are inspired by how the Internet has revolutionized communications infrastructure, by pushing intelligence to the edges while hiding the diversity of underlying technologies through well-defined interfaces. Any end device is a traffic source or sink and intelligent endpoints adapt their traffic to what the infrastructure can support. Our challenge is to understand how these principles can be suitably applied in formulating a new information-centric energy network for the 21st Century. We believe that an information-centric approach can achieve significant efficiencies in how electrical energy is distributed and used. The existing Grid assumes energy is cheap and information about its generation, distribution and use is expensive. Looking forward, energy will be dear, but pervasive information will allow us to use it more effectively, by agilely dispatching it to where it is needed, integrating intermittent renewable sources and intelligently adapting loads to match the available energy."

    Abstract = {Sensor network research has facilitated advancements in various domains, such as industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, etc., and research challenges have shifted from creating infrastructure to utilizing it.
Commercial buildings provide a valuable setting for investigating automated metadata acquisition and augmentation, as they
typically comprise large sensor networks, but have limited, obscure 'tags' that are often meaningful only to the facility managers. Moreover, this primitive metadata is imprecise and varies across vendors and deployments. Extracting meaningful information from a building's sensor data, or control applications using the data, depends on the metadata available to interpret it, whether provided by novel networks or legacy instrumentation.

This state-of-the-art is a fundamental barrier to scaling analytics or intelligent control across the building stock, as even the basic steps involve labor intensive manual efforts by highly trained consultants. Writing building applications on its sensor network remains largely intractable as it involves extensive help from an expert in each building's design and operation to identify the sensors of interest and create the associated metadata. This process is repeated for each application development in a particular building, and across different buildings. This results in customized building-specific application queries which are not portable or scalable across buildings. 

We present a synthesis technique that learns how to transform a building's primitive sensor metadata to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert, such as the building manager. Once the transformation rules are learned for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar metadata structure. This common and understandable namespace can enable analytics applications that do not require apriori building-specific knowledge.

Initial results show that learning the rules to transform 70% of the primitive metadata of two buildings (with completely different metadata structure), comprising 1600 and 2600 sensors, into a common namespace took only 21 and 27 examples respectively. The learned rules were able to transform similar primitive metadata in about 60 other buildings as well, enabling writing of portable applications across these buildings.}

Many modern buildings have a sensing infrastructure that can be used to do fine-grained accounting and under- stand the complex interactions between systems and spaces. However, through our experience with an active, campus-wide Building Management System (BMS) system, we observe that BMSs are not well suited for this task.
In buildings, there is a fundamental relationship be- tween systems and spaces. The Integrated Sensor- Stream Storage System (IS4) captures this relationship by constructing a resource hierarchy that names mea- surement instruments relative to their context. This al- lows us to bring together systems and spaces through the instruments within them. Furthermore, IS4 keeps track of changes in the hierarchy over time. It is also de- signed to simplify data acquisition and exploits the nam- ing structure for simpler, context-dependent queries. We have implemented IS4 and are currently using it to mon- itor Cory Hall at UC Berkeley as well as independent deployments at Samsung, Intel, and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.}

abstract = {Sensor network research has facilitated advancements in various domains, such as industrial monitoring, environmental sensing, etc., and research challenges have shifted from creating infrastructure to utilizing it. Extracting meaningful information from sensor data, or control applications using the data, depends on the metadata available to interpret it, whether provided by novel networks or legacy instrumentation. Commercial buildings provide a valuable setting for investigating automated metadata acquisition and augmentation, as they typically comprise large sensor networks, but have limited, obscure metadata that are often meaningful only to the facility managers. Moreover, this primitive metadata is imprecise and varies across vendors and deployments.This state-of-the-art is a fundamental barrier to scaling analytics or intelligent control across the building stock, as even the basic steps involve labor intensive manual efforts by highly trained consultants. Writing building applications on its sensor network remains largely intractable as it involves extensive help from an expert in each building's design and operation to identify the sensors of interest and create the associated metadata. This process is repeated for each application development in a particular building, and across different buildings. This results in customized building-specific application queries which are not portable or scalable across buildings.We present a synthesis technique that learns how to transform a building's primitive sensor metadata to a common namespace by using a small number of examples from an expert, such as the building manager. Once the transformation rules are learned for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar primitive metadata structure. This common and understandable namespace captures the semantic relationship between sensors, enabling analytics applications that do not require apriori building-specific knowledge.Initial results show that learning the rules to transform 70% of the primitive metadata of two buildings (with completely different metadata structure), comprising 1600 and 2600 sensors, into a common namespace ([1]) took only 21 and 27 examples respectively(Figure 1c). The learned rules were able to transform similar primitive metadata in other buildings as well(Figure 1d), enabling writing of portable applications across these buildings. The techniques developed here may be applicable to the other large legacy sensor networks, such as industrial processing, or urban monitoring.},

abstract = {Extracting meaningful information from a building's sensor data, or writing control applications using the data, depends on the metadata available to interpret it, whether provided by novel networks or legacy instrumentation. Commercial buildings comprise large sensor networks, but have limited, obscure 'tags' that are often meaningful only to the facility managers. Moreover, this primitive metadata is imprecise and varies across vendors and deployments.This state-of-the-art is a fundamental barrier to scaling analytics or intelligent control across the building stock, as even the basic steps involve labor intensive manual efforts by highly trained consultants.

This process is repeated for each application development in a particular building, and across different buildings. This results in customized building-specific applications which are not portable or scalable across buildings.We have developed a synthesis technique( [2]) that learns how to transform (normalize) a building's primitive sensor metadata to a common namespace( similar to [1]) by using a small number of examples from an expert, such as the building manager (Figure 1). Once the transformation rules are learned for one building, it can be applied across buildings with a similar metadata structure. This common and understandable namespace automatically yields semantic relationships between sensors, which enable analytics applications that do not require apriori building-specific knowledge.In this demonstration, we present three efficiency and analytics applications --- (a) Identifying rogue thermal zones, i.e zones that require constant heating or cooling (b) Identifying stuck air flow dampers, and (c) Identifying the presence of night-time setbacks --- all built against our common namespace. We were able to apply these applications unmodified to more than 10 commercial buildings on the University of California, Berkeley campus. These buildings comprised sensor networks which were commissioned by two different vendors at different points in time over the last two decades. The applications helped identify candidate efficiency and comfort improvements in each of these buildings without any manual inspection.},

abstract = {With the decreasing cost of data collection and storage and advances in analytics, companies have begun prioritizing deep analysis of data from their buildings and energy systems. Many of these systems already contain large sensor deployments monitoring their health and operation. However, a reliable analysis pipeline can be difficult to set up initially. The data generated is often dirty and it can take significant resources -- days to months of manual inspection -- to find traces or segments that can be used for analysis and modeling. In this poster, we present some initial attempts to address this problem by identifying and ranking the most useful traces, with respect to application-level relevance.},

abstract = {We present a system that uses acoustic signals to monitor equipment in commercial buildings, such as in machine rooms with HVAC system components. The system uses an ensemble of machine learning classifiers to effectively label signals as either "normal" or "abnormal". We collect audio clips from mobile devices in a machine room and an elevator shaft in the main building of IBM Research. We use these to learn the spectrum of normal sound signatures and identify abnormal sounds that fall outside this range. Abnormal sounds detected by the system are presented to the end user for anomaly confirmation. We also integrate a work-order system to automatically issue a repair work-order if the sound is abnormal.},

abstract = {Most large, commercial buildings contain thousands of sensors that are manually deployed and managed. These sensors are used by software and firmware processes to analyze and control building operations. Many such processes rely on sensor placement information in order to perform correctly. However, as buildings evolve and building subsystems grow and change, managing placement information becomes burdensome and error-prone. An automatic verification process is needed. We investigate empirical methods to automate spatial verification. We find that a spatial clustering algorithm is able to classify relative sensor locations -- for 15 sensors, spread across five rooms in a building -- with 93.3\% accuracy, 13\% better than a k-means clustering-based baseline method. Analysis on the raw time series data has a classification accuracy of only 53\%. By decomposing the signal into intrinsic modes and performing correlation analysis, an observable, statistical boundary emerges that corresponds to a physical one. These results may suggest that automatic verification of placement information is possible.},

With smartphones becoming increasingly ubiquitous and sensor networks growing more mature, buildings can provide personalized and context-aware services to an occupant while minimizing energy consumption. This paper proposes the architecture of a Human-Building-Computer Interaction system that connects the building to its occupants by bridging the gap between the digital and physical worlds. We present our instantiation of an HBCI system, which is composed of an Android mobile application, a number of RESTful services in the cloud, and physical objects co-located with QR tags. We show that, with this system, a user can increase personal comfort within a building while reducing energy usage.},
